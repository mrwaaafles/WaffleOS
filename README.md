# WaffleOS
This is the offical Github Repository for Waffle OS. It is heavily in development.  
### The Story
Waffle OS was started in early 2022 by Waffle.  
At the time Waffle knew very little about OS Development, but after trial and error, (and multiple trips to OSDev.org), He made the bootloader and kernel.  
After that the development exploded, and terminal drivers began to be made. A simple message was made to print, and more. The Goal never changed. Build an OS that can run executibles things from Windows, Mac, Linux, and Itself, Be used by advanced and simple computer users, and still be extremely preformant.
